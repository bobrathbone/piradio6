WiFi Link Quality Notes
=======================
**-30 dBm** Maximum signal strength, usually attained if the RPi is very close to the Wi-Fi access point    Excellent for all services

**-50 dBm** Anything down to this level can be regarded as excellent signal strength    Excellent for all services

**-60 dBm** This is still a good, reliable signal strength  Good for all services

**-67 dBm** This is the minimum value for all services that require smooth and reliable data traffic.       Minimum required for streaming services including for the radio

**-70 dBm** The signal is not very strong, but mostly sufficient.   Only good for Web browsing, email, and the like

**-80 dBm** Minimum value required to make a connection. You cannot count on a reliable connection or sufficient signal strength to use services at this level  The radio will not work reliably at this level

**-90 dBm** It is very unlikely that you will be able to connect or make use of any services with this signal strength. The radio cannot operate reliably at this level.

If the signal strength is poor, try re-positioning the radio nearer the router or use a repeater (TP-Link or similar). Position away from radiators or other large metal objects such as fridges and freezers.
