Pairing a Bluetooth device
==========================

Switch on the Bluetooth speakers or headphones.  Reboot the Raspberry Pi.
To pair your Bluetooth device run bluetoothctl. This will enter its own shell.
```
bluetoothctl
Agent registered
[bluetooth]#
```
Do not mistake the # prompt for the root (super-user) prompt. 

Make sure that the Bluetooth interface is powered on 

```
[bluetooth]# power on
[bluetooth]# scan on
[bluetooth]# agent on
Agent registered
[bluetooth]# default-agent
Default agent request successful
```

Switch on scanning.
```
[bluetooth]# scan on
Discovery started
[CHG] Controller DC:A6:32:05:36:9D Discovering: yes
[NEW] Device C0:48:E6:73:3D:FA [TV] Samsung Q7 Series (65)
[NEW] Device 00:75:58:41:B1:25 SP-AD70-B
```

When you see your Bluetooth speaker or headphones switch scan back off.

```
[bluetooth]# scan off
:
[CHG] Controller DC:A6:32:05:36:9D Discovering: no
Discovery stopped
```

In this example the device name is SP-AD70-B and has a Bluetooth ID of 00:75:58:41:B1:25.
Now pair the device using its ID:

```
[bluetooth]# pair 00:75:58:41:B1:25

Pairing successful
[CHG] Device 00:75:58:41:B1:25 ServicesResolved: no
[CHG] Device 00:75:58:41:B1:25 Connected: no
```

Now connect and trust the device:

```
[bluetooth]# connect 00:75:58:41:B1:25
Attempting to connect to 00:75:58:41:B1:25
[CHG] Device 00:75:58:41:B1:25 Connected: yes
Connection successful
[CHG] Device 00:75:58:41:B1:25 ServicesResolved: yes
```
Trust the new Bluetooth device

```
[SP-AD70-B]#trust 00:75:58:41:B1:25
[CHG] Device 00:75:58:41:B1:25 Trusted: yes
Changing 00:75:58:41:B1:25 trust succeeded
```

Check the newly paired device

```

Display Bluetooth devices with bluealsa-aplay

```
bluealsa-aplay -l
**** List of PLAYBACK Bluetooth Devices ****
hci0: 00:75:58:41:B1:25 [SP-AD70-B], trusted audio-headset
  A2DP (SBC): S16_LE 2 channels 48000 Hz
**** List of CAPTURE Bluetooth Devices ***
```
Note: Your display will vary depending upon the Bluetooth device just paired

Testing the Bluetooth device
============================
Stop the radio software (Important).
```
sudo systemctl stop radiod
```
Now run the following:
```
aplay -D bluealsa:SRV=org.bluealsa,DEV=00:75:58:41:B1:25,PROFILE=a2dp /usr/share/sounds/alsa/Front_Center.wav
```

**Note:** The above is all one line. Substitute the above Bluetooth address with your own address. 
If things are working correctly, a spoken “Front Center” should be heard from the Bluetooth device.
