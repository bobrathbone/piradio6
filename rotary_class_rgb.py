#
# A typical mechanical rotary encoder emits a two bit gray code
# on 3 output pins. Every step in the output (often accompanied
# by a physical 'click') generates a specific sequence of output
# codes on the pins.
#
# There are 3 pins used for the rotary encoding - one common and
# two 'bit' pins.
#
# The following is the typical sequence of code on the output when
# moving from one step to the next:
#
#   Position   Bit1   Bit2
#   ----------------------
#     Step1     0      0
#      1/4      1      0
#      1/2      1      1
#      3/4      0      1
#     Step2     0      0
#
# From this table, we can see that when moving from one 'click' to
# the next, there are 4 changes in the output code.
#
# - From an initial 0 - 0, Bit1 goes high, Bit0 stays low.
# - Then both bits are high, halfway through the step.
# - Then Bit1 goes low, but Bit2 stays high.
# - Finally at the end of the step, both bits return to 0.
#
# Detecting the direction is easy - the table simply goes in the other
# direction (read up instead of down).
#
# To decode this, we use a simple state machine. Every time the output
# code changes, it follows state, until finally a full steps worth of
# code is received (in the correct order). At the final 0-0, it returns
# a value indicating a step in one direction or the other.
#
# It's also possible to use 'half-step' mode. This just emits an event
# at both the 0-0 and 1-1 positions. This might be useful for some
# encoders where you want to detect all positions.
#
# If an invalid state happens (for example we go from '0-1' straight
# to '1-0'), the state machine resets to the start until 0-0 and the
# next valid codes occur.
#
# The biggest advantage of using a state machine over other algorithms
# is that this has inherent debounce built in. Other algorithms emit spurious
# output with switch bounce, but this one will simply flip between
# sub-states until the bounce settles, then continue along the state
# machine.
# A side effect of debounce is that fast rotations can cause steps to
# be skipped. By not requiring debounce, fast rotations can be accurately
# measured.
# Another advantage is the ability to properly handle bad state, such
# as due to EMI, etc.
# It is also a lot simpler than others - a static state table and less
# than 10 lines of logic.
