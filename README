This program uses  Music Player Daemon 'mpd', its client 'mpc' and the python3-mpd library
See http://www.musicpd.org/
Use "sudo apt-get install mpd mpc python3-mpd" to install the Music Player Daemon (MPD)
This software uses the python3-mpd library. See https://packages.debian.org/sid/python3-mpd

To configure the radio software and components run: radio-config from the command line

3) New configuration parameter ky040_r1_fitted added to set KY040 switch (SW) pullup resistor
4) New check_voltage.sh script added to check CPU and RAM voltage, temperature etc
5) Radio configuration (radio-confg) now calls most other scripts from a top level menu
6) New parameter no_internet_switch yes/no to switch to MEDIA if no Internet for the radio
7) New create_keymap.py script to create IR remote control keymaps
