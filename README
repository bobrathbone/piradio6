This program uses  Music Player Daemon 'mpd', its client 'mpc' and the python3-mpd library
See http://www.musicpd.org/
Use "sudo apt-get install mpd mpc python3-mpd" to install the Music Player Daemon (MPD)
This software uses the python3-mpd library. See https://packages.debian.org/sid/python3-mpd

To configure the radio software and components run: radio-config from the command line

Version 8.1 release notes

1) Prevent radio program from crashing if no IP network and no media to load
2) Support for the Waveshare 1.5 and 2.42-Inch SPI interface OLEDs added
3) New configuration parameter ky040_r1_fitted added to set KY040 switch (SW) pullup resistor
4) New check_voltage.sh script added to check CPU and RAM voltage, temperature etc
5) Radio configuration (radio-confg) now calls most other scripts from a top level menu
6) New parameter no_internet_switch yes/no to switch to MEDIA if no Internet for the radio
7) New create_keymap.py script to create IR remote control keymaps
8) Creating Media playlists no longer needs to stop the radio
9) build64.sh and piradio64 removed. build.sh builds both 32 and 64-bit packages
10) New record radio stations function added (record.py) using streamripper
11) Streaming indicator after the date changed from '*' to '+'. '*' is recording indicator
12) Recording switches on the activity led if the IR event daemon (ireventd.py) is running

17) New scrolling=yes/no configuration parameter to switch message scrolling on/off
18) Volume control now adjusts both WM8960 soundcard Speaker and Headphone volume together
19) Package build now produces a single build for both 32 and 64-bit installation
20) Facility to add radio stations via Web Interface (O!MPD) implemented
21) Scroll speed in the ST7789 screen class can now be set in /etc/radiod.conf 
22) Improved IR remote control selection of radio stations and tracks
23) Display new IR remote control selection on the bottom line for 1 second
24) Implemented IR remote control selection in touch-screen versions of the radio (gradio & vgradio)
25) Update HiFiBerry DAC DT overlays for kernels > 6.1.77 (Bookworm onwards)
