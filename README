This program uses  Music Player Daemon 'mpd', its client 'mpc' and the python3-mpd library
See http://www.musicpd.org/
Use "sudo apt-get install mpd mpc python3-mpd" to install the Music Player Daemon (MPD)
This software uses the python3-mpd library. See https://packages.debian.org/sid/python3-mpd

To configure the radio software and components run: 
radio-config
from the command line
