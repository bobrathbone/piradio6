Downloading and creating the radiod package
===========================================
To create the radiod Debian package log into the Raspberry Pi and clone the source tree from GitHub.
```
cd
git clone https://github.com/bobrathbone/piradio6
```
Now change directory to **radio6** and make **setup.sh** executable then run it.
```
cd piradio6
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```
This will install all of the necessary packages for the development environment and then run **build.sh**. 
The **setup.sh** script only needs to be run once. Subsequent builds can be done by just running the **./build.sh** script.
*Note:* The control file for the package build is called **piradio**
```
./build.sh
```
Finally install the new package. 
```
sudo dpkg -i radiod_8.0_all.deb
```
This will install the **radiod** package and supporting files in the **/usr/share/radio** directory. 
To configure the **radiod** package further run **radio-config** from the command line.
```
radio-config
```
