RPi/GPIO.py
===========

The GPIO.py code is only for use with the Raspberry Pi Model 5.
Do not use it for earlier models such as the Model 3B or 4

It is designed to intercept GPIO calls and convert them to LGPIO calls.
See: https://abyz.me.uk/lg/py_lgpio.html

Pre-requsites
=============
Install package python3-lgpio
sudo apt install python3-lgpio

Installation
============
Create a sub-directory called RPi in the directory where your GPIO code is installed
For example code in directory /usr/share/radio:

cd /usr/share/radio
mkdir RPi
cp <source>/GPIO.py /usr/share/radio/RPi/.
Note: The radiod package installation script has already done this

Enabling GPIO.py
================
For a Raspberry Pi model 5 or running if Bookworm only. Example:
touch /usr/share/radio/RPi/__init__.py
The instruction above will cause the code using the GPIO calls to see directory RPi as a pacckage.

For earlier models such as the 3B or 4 disable the package
rm /usr/share/radio/RPi/__init__.py

Support
=======
It is not possible to provide support for GPIO.py as literally hundreds of thousands of programs
using GPIO routines. The code is provided as is and without any warranties or "fit for purpose" etc.
