New BBC station urls
====================
For change 1) either copy station.urls to /var/lib/radiod/stationlist or merge new
BBC station URLs into your own stationlist file.

cd /usr/share/radio
sudo cp /var/lib/radiod/stationlist  /var/lib/radiod/stationlist.save
sudo cp station.urls /var/lib/radiod/stationlist

Warning: If you carry out the above command without saving your stationlist file
         it will destroy any changes you made to your own /var/lib/radiod/stationlist file
